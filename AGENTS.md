## 📝 Project-Specific Guidelines

### Tone and Style

*   **Art Gallery with Humor:** The overall tone of the project, especially in user-facing documentation like READMEs, should be that of a slightly quirky art gallery curator. Think "art gallery with a bit of humor".

### Bash Compatibility

*   **Bash v3.2 is the target**: The main `screensaver.sh` script must be compatible with Bash v3.2. This is to ensure it runs on a wide variety of systems, including older macOS versions.
*   **Individual screensavers**: Individual screensavers can use newer bash features, but it's good practice to stick to v3.2 if possible.
*   **Cross-platform**: All scripts should be written to be cross-platform, working on macOS, Linux, WSL, Cygwin, etc. Avoid using platform-specific commands without fallbacks.

### Bash Scripting Style

The following scripting guidelines are heavily based on the **[Bash Style Guide by Dave Eddy](https://style.ysap.sh)**, which should be considered the primary reference for style. Adhere to the following principles to ensure scripts are safe, predictable, and maintainable.

-   **Shebang:** Start scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for portability.
-   **Error Checking:** Always check for potential errors, especially for commands that can fail, like `cd`.
    ```bash
    # wrong
    cd /some/path
    rm file

    # right
    cd /some/path || exit 1
    rm file
    ```
-   **`set -e`:** Do not use `set -e`. Handle errors explicitly. It can have unintended consequences.
-   **Quoting:** This is critical.
    -   Use double quotes (`"`) for strings that require variable expansion.
    -   Use single quotes (`'`) for all other literal strings.
    -   **Always quote variable expansions** (`"$var"`) to prevent word-splitting and globbing issues.
-   **Variables:**
    -   Use lowercase variable names (e.g., `my_var`).
    -   Use `local` for all variables inside functions.
-   **Functions:**
    -   Do not use the `function` keyword.
    -   Use `my_func() { ... }` syntax.
-   **Conditionals:**
    -   Always use `[[ ... ]]` for conditional testing, not `[ ... ]` or `test`.
    -   Use `((...))` for arithmetic comparisons (e.g., `((a > b))`).
-   **Command Substitution:**
    -   Always use `$(...)` for command substitution, not backticks.
-   **Arrays:**
    -   Use Bash arrays to manage lists of items instead of space-separated strings.
    -   Iterate over arrays using `for item in "${my_array[@]}"; do ... done`.
-   **Avoid External Commands:**
    -   Use Bash's built-in parameter expansion for string manipulation (e.g., `${var/foo/bar}`).
    -   Use globbing (`*`) to iterate over files, not `ls`.
    -   Avoid `cat` when a command can read a file directly (e.g., `grep "pattern" file`).
-   **`eval`:** Never use `eval`.

### Screen Handling

*   **`tput` is your friend**: Use `tput` for all screen manipulations, such as moving the cursor, changing colors, and clearing the screen. This ensures that the scripts are portable across different terminal types.
*   **Colors**: Use `tput setaf` (foreground) and `tput setab` (background) for colors. The standard 8-color palette is the most portable.
*   **Animations**: Animations are created by a loop of clearing the screen (or parts of it), drawing the next frame, and then sleeping for a short period. `sleep 0.1` is a common choice.

### Project Structure

*   **`screensaver.sh`**: The main entry point. It displays a menu of screensavers and runs the chosen one.
*   **`gallery/`**: Each subdirectory in `gallery/` is a screensaver.
    *   `<name>/<name>.sh`: The main script for the screensaver.
    *   `<name>/config.sh`: Metadata for the screensaver (name, tagline, etc.).
*   **`spotlight/`**: Contains helper scripts for generating previews and other marketing materials.
*   **`jury/`**: Contains the `bats` test suite.

### General Tips

*   **Cleanup is crucial**: Always use `trap` to ensure that the terminal is restored to a usable state when the user presses `Ctrl+C`. This includes showing the cursor again (`tput cnorm`), resetting colors (`tput sgr0`), and clearing the screen.
*   **Subshells for safety**: The main `screensaver.sh` script runs each screensaver in a subshell. This is to prevent the screensaver from accidentally exiting the main menu.
*   **Tools**: This project uses `asciinema` to record terminal sessions as `.cast` files and `agg` to convert those `.cast` files into animated GIFs. The `spotlight/smile-for-the-camera.sh` script automates this process.

## 🧪 Testing

The tests for this project are written using the `bats` (Bash Automated Testing System) framework.

### Running Tests

The tests should be run from the root of the repository using the project-specific command, which executes all test files in the `jury/` directory:
```bash
bats jury
```
To run a specific test file, you can execute `bats jury/my_test.bats`.

### Test Structure

Tests are located in the `jury/` directory. The main test file is `jury/tests.bats`, which tests the main `screensaver.sh` script. There are also individual test files for each screensaver.

A BATS test file is a Bash script with special syntax. Here is a typical structure:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bats

# setup() { ... } # optional: runs before each test
# teardown() { ... } # optional: runs after each test

@test "description of the test" {
  # The test code goes here
  run my_script "some argument"
  [ "$status" -eq 0 ]
  [ "$output" = "expected output" ]
}
```

### Key BATS Concepts

*   **Key Variables**:
    *   `run`: Executes a command and captures its output and status code.
    *   `$status`: The exit status of the command run.
    *   `$output`: The combined stdout and stderr of the command run.
    *   `$lines`: An array containing each line of the output.

*   **Best Practices**:
    *   **Isolate Tests:** Each `@test` should be independent. Use `setup` and `teardown` functions to prepare and clean up the test environment if needed.
    *   **Be Specific:** Test descriptions should clearly state what is being tested.
    *   **Assert One Thing:** Ideally, each test should assert a single condition or outcome.
    *   **Use Helpers:** For complex setup or repeated assertions, create helper functions within your test files. BATS automatically exports functions that are not named `setup` or `teardown`.

### Project-Specific Considerations

*   **Dependencies**: The tests require `bats`, `bats-support`, and `bats-assert`. These are not checked in to the repository. Refer to the "Environment Setup Guide" in "Jules's Corner" for instructions on installing them using the `assemble-the-jury.sh` script. It is better to download the release tarballs and extract them rather than cloning with `git`.
*   **Paths**: The test scripts are written with the assumption that they are being run from the root of the repository. All paths in the test files should be relative to the root.
*   **`timeout` and Assertions**: Many of the tests use `timeout` to run the screensavers for a short period. Since the screensavers are designed to run indefinitely, `timeout` will kill them, resulting in a non-zero exit code. Therefore, the tests should use `assert_failure` to check for this expected failure, not `assert_success`.
*   **Environment Limitations**: The testing environment can be restrictive. Commands like `cd`, `pwd`, and `git restore` may not work as expected. It's important to be aware of these limitations and find workarounds when necessary.

## Learnings on Test Execution and Reporting

This section documents the work done to simplify test execution and reporting.

1.  **Idempotent Dependency Installation:**
    *   **Issue:** The `assemble-the-jury.sh` script would re-download dependencies on every run, which was slow and could fail due to network timeouts.
    *   **Resolution:** I modified the script to first check if the dependency directories exist before attempting to download and extract them. This makes the script idempotent and much faster on subsequent runs.

2.  **Automated Test Runner:**
    *   **Issue:** Running the tests required two separate commands: one to install dependencies and another to run the `bats` suite. The process was manual and didn't save the results.
    *   **Resolution:** I created a new script, `jury/render-the-verdict.sh`, which automates the entire process. It calls `assemble-the-jury.sh` and then runs the test suite twice, saving the output to `jury/verdict.txt` (human-readable) and `jury/verdict.tap` (machine-readable).

3.  **Location-Independent Scripts:**
    *   **Issue:** The initial version of `render-the-verdict.sh` relied on being run from the repository root.
    *   **Resolution:** I refactored the script to be location-independent. It now uses `dirname` on `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` to determine its own location and constructs absolute paths, allowing it to be run from anywhere on the system.

4.  **Fix for Hanging Trap Handler:**
    *   **Issue:** The test suite was timing out because the `life.sh` script had a `read` command in its `trap cleanup` function, which would hang in a non-interactive environment. This issue was previously noted in the `tour-the-gallery.sh` learnings but the fix was not applied here.
    *   **Resolution:** I removed the problematic `read` command from `gallery/life/life.sh`, allowing the script to terminate correctly when sent a signal by `timeout`.

5.  **Fix for Incorrect Trap Handlers:**
    *   **Issue:** Some scripts, like `cutesaver.sh`, were only trapping `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C). This meant that when run under `timeout` (which sends `SIGTERM`), their cleanup functions would not execute, potentially leaving the terminal in a bad state.
    *   **Resolution:** I updated the `trap` commands in these scripts to also catch `EXIT`, `TERM`, and `QUIT`, ensuring that cleanup always runs.

6.  **New Screensaver Template Fix:**
    *   **Issue:** The template used to create new screensavers (`screensaver.sh --new`) contained the same incorrect `trap` handler, which would have propagated the bug to all new screensavers.
    *   **Resolution:** I updated the template in `screensaver.sh` to use the correct, robust `trap` command.

# 👨‍💻 Jules's Corner

This section contains notes and learnings specific to the agent Jules.

### Environment Setup Guide

To prepare the environment for development and testing, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Core Dependencies:** The project requires `bc`. You can install it using the appropriate package manager (e.g., `apt-get install bc` or `brew install bc`).
2.  **Set up the Test Suite:** The BATS test suite has dependencies that are not in the repository. Run the following script to download and install them locally into `jury/test_libs/`:
    ```bash
    ./jury/assemble-the-jury.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the Tests:** To verify the setup, run the full test suite using the automated runner script. The results will be saved in `jury/verdict.txt` and `jury/verdict.tap`.
    ```bash
    ./jury/render-the-verdict.sh
    ```
4.  **Be Aware of Environment Constraints:**
    *   **`agg` Installation:** The `agg` tool for GIF generation is difficult to install. Refer to the "Learnings on `agg` Installation" section for details on what has been tried.
    *   **`asciinema` Version:** The installed version of `asciinema` does not support the `cut` subcommand.
    *   **Filesystem Persistence:** When running a series of commands that depend on each other (like downloading and then extracting a file), chain them together in a single `run_in_bash_session` call with `&&` to avoid issues with filesystem persistence between tool calls.

## Learnings on `tour-the-gallery.sh`

This document summarizes the issues I encountered and the solutions I implemented while debugging the `spotlight/tour-the-gallery.sh` script.

### Key Issues and Resolutions

1.  **Non-Standard Timeout Function:**
    *   **Issue:** The script initially used a custom `run_with_timeout` function which was not accessible within the subshell created by `asciinema rec`, causing recording failures.
    *   **Resolution:** I replaced the custom function with the standard Linux `timeout` command for better portability and reliability.

2.  **Hidden Dependency (`bc`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `speaky.sh` screensaver failed because it depends on the `bc` command-line calculator, which was not installed in the environment.
    *   **Resolution:** I identified and installed the `bc` package to satisfy the dependency.

3.  **Unsupported `asciinema` Subcommand:**
    *   **Issue:** The script used the `asciinema cut` subcommand, which is not available in the version of `asciinema` present in the execution environment.
    *   **Resolution:** I refactored the recording logic. Instead of recording a long 10-second clip and cutting a 3-second snippet, the script now directly records a 3-second snippet after a 3-second pause (`sleep 3; timeout 3s ...`), eliminating the need for the `cut` command.

4.  **Interactive Scripts in Non-Interactive Environment:**
    *   **Issue:** Several screensavers (e.g., `cutesaver.sh`, `life.sh`) used interactive `read` commands to pause between frames or wait for user input. This caused the main script to hang indefinitely.
    *   **Resolution:** I replaced the interactive `read` commands in the affected screensavers with non-interactive `sleep` commands.

### Unresolved Issues & Final State

*   **Persistent Timeouts:** Despite the fixes above, the `tour-the-gallery.sh` script continues to time out during the final step of converting the concatenated `.cast` file into a `.gif` using the `agg` command.
*   **Hypothesis:** The timeout is likely caused by one of two things:
    1.  The `agg` command is extremely slow when processing the large, concatenated `overview.cast` file.
    2.  One of the screensavers is still producing a subtly malformed `.cast` file that isn't caught by the validation logic, causing `agg` to hang or fail silently (by creating an empty GIF).

## Learnings on `agg` Installation

The `spotlight/smile-for-the-camera.sh` script requires the `agg` tool to generate GIFs. During my work on this project, I encountered significant difficulties installing `agg` in the provided environment. This section documents the issues for future reference.

*   **`pip install agg`:** The `pip` package for `agg` does not seem to install an executable, but rather a library. This means that `command -v agg` will fail even after a successful `pip` installation.
*   **Pre-built Binaries:** The official documentation for `agg` recommends downloading a pre-built binary from the GitHub releases page. However, I was unable to find a direct download link for the correct architecture (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`) on the releases page. My attempts to guess the URL resulted in 404 errors.
*   **`x-cmd`:** I found a third-party tool called `x-cmd` that simplifies the installation of command-line tools. However, `x-cmd` itself is not installed in this environment, so I was unable to use it.

Due to these issues, I was unable to get a working version of `agg` installed. The tasks related to fixing the GIF generation for the `pipes` and `life` screensavers have been postponed until this issue can be resolved.

## Learnings on the Bats Test Environment

This section documents the issues encountered while attempting to fix the `bats` test suite in the `jury/` directory.

### Key Issues and Resolutions

1.  **Dependency Management:**
    *   **Issue:** The `bats` test dependencies (`bats-core`, `bats-support`, `bats-assert`) are not checked into the repository.
    *   **Resolution:** I created a setup script at `jury/assemble-the-jury.sh` to automate the download and extraction of these dependencies into a `jury/test_libs/` directory. I also added this directory to the `.gitignore` file.

2.  **Filesystem Persistence in the Environment:**
    *   **Issue:** The execution environment appears to have issues with filesystem persistence between separate `run_in_bash_session` tool calls. Changes made in one call (like downloading a file) were not always present in the next call, leading to "No such file or directory" errors.
    *   **Workaround:** To get a consistent result, I had to chain all commands (dependency download, extraction, and test execution) into a single, long `run_in_bash_session` command using `&&`.

### Unresolved Issues & Final State

*   **Path Loading in Bats:** The primary blocker is an issue with how `bats` loads dependency files. The test scripts use relative paths (e.g., `load 'libs/bats-support/load'`). My attempts to correct these paths to point to the new `jury/test_libs` directory were unsuccessful.
*   **Hypothesis:** The `bats` executable, when run from the repository root, seems to have an unexpected behavior in this environment when resolving the relative `load` paths from within the test files. For example, my attempts to change the path to `jury/test_libs/bats-support/load` resulted in `bats` looking for `/app/jury/jury/test_libs/...`, indicating a misinterpretation of the path. All attempts to modify the files programmatically resulted in corrupted paths.
*   **Final State:** The test environment setup is now automated via `jury/assemble-the-jury.sh`. However, the tests themselves are still not runnable due to the path loading issue. The `.bats` files have been restored to their original, incorrect state. A future developer should focus on fixing the `load` paths within the `.bats` files, perhaps by experimenting with different relative paths (`../test_libs`) or other `bats` loading mechanisms.
