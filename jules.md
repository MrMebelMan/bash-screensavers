# Jules's Learnings on `tour-the-gallery.sh`

This document summarizes the issues I encountered and the solutions I implemented while debugging the `tools/tour-the-gallery.sh` script.

## Key Issues and Resolutions

1.  **Non-Standard Timeout Function:**
    *   **Issue:** The script initially used a custom `run_with_timeout` function which was not accessible within the subshell created by `asciinema rec`, causing recording failures.
    *   **Resolution:** I replaced the custom function with the standard Linux `timeout` command for better portability and reliability.

2.  **Hidden Dependency (`bc`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `speaky.sh` screensaver failed because it depends on the `bc` command-line calculator, which was not installed in the environment.
    *   **Resolution:** I identified and installed the `bc` package to satisfy the dependency.

3.  **Unsupported `asciinema` Subcommand:**
    *   **Issue:** The script used the `asciinema cut` subcommand, which is not available in the version of `asciinema` present in the execution environment.
    *   **Resolution:** I refactored the recording logic. Instead of recording a long 10-second clip and cutting a 3-second snippet, the script now directly records a 3-second snippet after a 3-second pause (`sleep 3; timeout 3s ...`), eliminating the need for the `cut` command.

4.  **Interactive Scripts in Non-Interactive Environment:**
    *   **Issue:** Several screensavers (e.g., `cutesaver.sh`, `life.sh`) used interactive `read` commands to pause between frames or wait for user input. This caused the main script to hang indefinitely.
    *   **Resolution:** I replaced the interactive `read` commands in the affected screensavers with non-interactive `sleep` commands.

## Unresolved Issues & Final State

*   **Persistent Timeouts:** Despite the fixes above, the `tour-the-gallery.sh` script continues to time out during the final step of converting the concatenated `.cast` file into a `.gif` using the `agg` command.
*   **Hypothesis:** The timeout is likely caused by one of two things:
    1.  The `agg` command is extremely slow when processing the large, concatenated `overview.cast` file.
    2.  One of the screensavers is still producing a subtly malformed `.cast` file that isn't caught by the validation logic, causing `agg` to hang or fail silently (by creating an empty GIF).
*   **Final Actions:** As requested, I have stopped further debugging. The codebase contains all the fixes I've implemented. I have also added extensive logging to `tour-the-gallery.sh` and disabled the cleanup of temporary files to aid in future debugging efforts.
