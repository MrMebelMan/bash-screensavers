# Bash Screensavers

![Logo](spotlight/logos/logo.320x160.png)

Tired of your boring old terminal?
Wish you could spice up your command line with some animated ASCII art?
Well, you've come to the right place!

Welcome to **Bash Screensavers**,
a collection of screensavers written entirely in `bash`.

Because who needs fancy graphics cards and complex rendering engines
when you have `echo`, `sleep`, and a little bit of `tput` magic?
