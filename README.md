# Bash Screensavers

![Logo](spotlight/logos/logo.320x160.png)

Tired of your boring old terminal?
Wish you could spice up your command line with some animated ASCII art?
Well, you've come to the right place!

Welcome to **Bash Screensavers**, a collection of screensavers written entirely in `bash`.

Because who needs fancy graphics cards and complex rendering engines
when you have `echo`, `sleep`, and a little bit of `tput` magic?

## Quickstart

To get started, clone the repository and run the main script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/attogram/bash-screensavers.git
cd bash-screensavers
./screensaver.sh

This will display the interactive menu where you can choose a screensaver.

### Command-Line Usage

*   `./screensaver.sh [name]`: Launch a specific screensaver by its name (e.g., `matrix`).
*   `./screensaver.sh [number]`: Launch a specific screensaver by its number from the menu.
*   `./screensaver.sh -r` or `--random`: Launch a random screensaver.
*   `./screensaver.sh -h` or `--help`: Display the help message.
*   `./screensaver.sh -v` or `--version`: Display the version information.

Vibe coders and [AI Assistants](./AGENTS.md) are welcome to join the party.

## Spotlight

The spotlight is a set of curator tools for marketing and publicity fluff,
like pretty previews of all the screensavers.

Read the [Spotlight Manual](./spotlight/README.md) for details.

## Jury

The jury makes sure the gallery is up-to-snuff. 

They test **everything**. They're a bit batsy about it.

See the [Jury Criteria](./jury/README.md) for the rules.

## Library
Think of this as the art supply closet for our digital gallery. It's filled with reusable scripts and functions—our special blend of paints, brushes, and canvases—to help you craft your own visual masterpieces in bash.

Step into the [workshop](./library/README.md) and see what's available.
